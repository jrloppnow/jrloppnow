## Hi there 👋

I'm Jeferson Loppnow and I've been working with data analysis since 2017 and since 2023 I've managed to migrate to the IT area. 
Today I'm a Senior Data Engineer at a large global food company, with a degree in Commercial Management and a specialization in Big Data & Data Science. 

On Udemy I have two recorded courses, one on VBA, where I teach the whole structure from basic to advanced, and another course where I teach how to build a robot to send messages with text and attachments via WhatsApp.

In my “spare time” I record videos on analytics on the YouTube channel “Excel & Other Things”.
